# ActivityTracker ‚Äì iOS App Prototype for Effortless Activity Logging
An iOS app prototype built with AI tools to track personalized activities featuring custom activity logging and time-since-last tracking.

---

## üìå Overview

**Goal:** Help users log personalized, recurring activities in under 5 seconds  
**Target Users:** Minimalist app lovers, habit trackers, and people managing routines  
**Platform:** iOS (iPhone), iOS 14+  
**Tools Used:** Figma, SwiftUI, CoreData, WidgetKit, AI (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini), Cursor IDE  
**Duration:** 2 days (MVP)

---

## üß† Motivation

Generic habit-tracking apps often overwhelm users with complex flows and irrelevant features. This project addresses that gap by offering a **clean, fast, frictionless** way to log specific recurring activities‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre physical (e.g., tennis), mental (e.g., meditation), or creative (e.g., songwriting).

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üß© In-App Features
- **Activity Creation**: Name, category (e.g., Hobby, Health), optional details, icon
- **Main Dashboard**: Days since last completion, total count, quick complete button
- **Activity Management**: Edit, delete, reorder, and view filtered history
- **Completion History**: 7/31/90/365-day views

### üß∑ Home Screen Widget
- **Swipeable display** of all tracked activities
- **Quick mark-as-complete** with animated visual feedback
- **Auto-reset** each day (local timezone)
- Widget logic synced with main app via App Group and CoreData

| Product Ideation       | Figma, Notion, pen & paper                                                  |
| iOS Development        | Xcode, SwiftUI, WidgetKit, CoreData, App Groups                             |
| AI-Assisted Workflow   | GPT-4.1 / GPT-4o (OpenAI), Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic), Gemini 2.5 (Google) |
| Dev IDE                | Cursor (AI-native code editor), GitHub Copilot                              |

I used AI tools to:
- Refine product decisions and technical specs
- Draft and debug Swift5/SwiftUI/WidgetKit code
- Co-write PRD and README content

## üí° Why This Project Matters

This prototype reflects my ability to:
- Translate **user problems into simple, focused features**
- Use **AI models not just for ideation, but for real-time development workflows**
- Work across **design, product, and technical layers**
- Deliver functional MVPs on tight timelines

It demonstrates how modern product development can be **AI-augmented, user-centred, and execution-driven**.
